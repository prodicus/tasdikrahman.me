## Trip Itenary

More than 18 stops. Covered a little more than 1700kms overall. My himachal trip!

<iframe src="https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/f8903d09026b4be3c6e94eca06c8e73e/himachal-trip/index.html" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="800"></iframe>

We all have that one trip with friends which gets cancelled no matter what right(goa anybody!)?

But hopefully, our decided trip was completed. Wasn't that smooth. But as the saying goes

> What is an ocean if it doesn't challenge the sailors!

Thanks to the recent [demonetization drive](www.wsj.com/articles/indias-demonetization-debacle-1481851086) by the Indian govt. We had to delay our plans for the trip for some days. We went along all fine.

## Shimla

I started from Dehradun on the night of 28th of November. Left for Delhi in the middle of the night, after much cajoling and reassurances to my mum that I wouldn't be doing bat-sh*t crazy stuff in my trip. Which was not entirely fulfilled as you will see after some time.

The bus ride was full of surprises as air seeped in through like water from the narrow gapes in the metal sheets. And how could I miss the creeking noise of the suspension. All this amounted to me not getting litle or no sleep at all througout the night. Add it to the amount of cold it was outside.

I was dropped well before my destination citing reasons of excessive fog and traffic. Panic? Rushing to the nearest metro station was the answer. Reached kashemere Gate from where we had our next bus to Shimla. Devaraj tagged along from there.

At least, the bus was a decent one. I completed on the sleep which I had missed while Devaraj blasted on EDM on his earphones!

We reached quite late. Late by the standards of Shimla! 8:30p.m was the time and we could not see a dog roaming around! The next shocker came when we got to know that the booked hotel was another 2 hour journey from where we were.

No wonder it was cheap when we booked! Heck it was in the middle of the jungle!

We cancelled the reservation and asked the taxi driver(as it was the only means of transport available at that time) to take us to a decent hotel within our specified budget.

250 bucks was what he took for just 2kms. Even airlines charge less than that! Heck, a normal bus ticket from dehradun to delhi costs around 230 INR. And we are looking at a distance of around 240 kms. If it was a time before the sun had set, I would have called it daylight robbery!

The sweet talking manager showed us our rooms which had a great view of shimla from the window. We settled down and changed. He continued babbling about the package which he would give us "at the cheapest rates in the country" and I quote. We said we would think about it and let him know in the morning!

Dinner at the local chinese shop and roamed around the famous mall road. Expensive! Things were priced off the roof for specific things.

Morning gave us a rude shock. This guy was trying to dupe us! He kept asking 3x the room amount for the car that he had supposedly booked for the two of us. We are not two drunk dudes who would rabble anything with people. After much shouting and drama, we settled with him for the booking amount of the room for the day.

Just when we were thinking that this trip was going a downhill drive, we had our impromptu rafting trip.

And boy it was amazing! 25kms of raw nature. I cannot articulate the feeling. 3 hours later, after countless rapids we reached back to the last spot from where we would be picked up.

The day ended on a high with some adventure sports at kufri which I missed up on my reluctance to not wake up from my slumber(read: drained out)

## Manali

Our 2 nights passed in Shimla went just fine. And on the 3rd day, we left for manali early in the morning.

Before I write any further. I confess that we were one of the guys who didn't know that kullu and manali were two different places altogether. Oh come on now. Don't go so hard on me!

So before Manali, you arrive at Kullu if you go by road from Shimla.

For a change, not everyone was trying to loot us. And it was a little warmer than Shimla. We got a decent room for ourselves and settled for the night.

Manali was a little over 9kms from our place and we left early the next morning.

It was a mix of Shimla's mall road and valleys that you find around in Pune. We visited the local tibetan monasteries, bought a lot of souvenirs and some indigenous handricrafts. Van vihar should have been prepended with a "big".Minus the fact that it was not snowing, I liked it more than Shimla.

We returned back to kullu the same night. ATMs were scarse. Further finding ATMs which had any money in them was like finding water in a desert. But we survived the night.

Kheerganga is a good destination for trekkers if you are in the mood of any of it. But we didn't plan it(read on)

## Kasol

In the similar lines of Shimla, 2 nights was all at kullu.

The next morning, we paid off the hotel manager. And asked him how to reach Kasol. And boy was he happy on hearing that word. Imagine a tall unshaven guy, wearing a tattered blue denim with a pair of Quechua's. Pair that along with a black hoodie and a monkey cap not of the ordinary types.

We first had to reach bhunter and then take a bus to kasol. We reached kasol just before sunset and got us a good room. It was a real steal at the price at which we got.

You ask why? Our room was situated right beside the parvati river. We had the fabled dhauladhar mountain range right in front of us. Add the fact that we were right in the middle of parvati valley. Picturesque? You bet!

The main Kasol is a small place and you can literally cover it within an hour of foot travel. All the shops and cafes are situated around a T-shaped area.

This place is a must for anybody who is attracted towards the hippie culture. You will find Israeli's buying groceries talking in fluent hindi. People roam around wearing long beads, colorful khakhi pants (imagine a purple tinge for example), flower print tops, unkempt dirty long hair(no offence) filled with beads.

Some Beatles and Bob Dylan music and there you are back to the late 1960s hippie culture of the United States.

## Manikaran

Manikaran is a little over 7-8kms from kasol. It was a little bigger than Kasol. It's mostly filled with tourists which have come over to visit the Ram temple. The only place worth visiting there. It has a natural hot spring in it's vicinity where you can find people overjoyed of playing inside it! And no, we didn't take a dip inside it. Why? Short on time on this trip. I must warn you that the irregular bus timings will really make you mad.

One night was enough for the whole thing!

## Dharamshala

This trip from Manikaran was the most gruelling bus trips.

Manikaran to kasol was the first leg. This went swiftly. Next stop was bhunter. After that we had to catch a bus for Mandi. All this consumed nothing but our patience and time. We reached Mandi just a little after 4o'clock.

Such was our luck that we just missed a direct bus for Dharamshala. We were famished! Our stomachs were empty since the raw Israeli breakfast that we had back at Kasol(it was Devaraj's idea).

We had some momo's at a local shop near the bus stand.

The alternatives at hand were to either catch a bus for a place near Dharamshala's vicinity and then pray that you got another bus from there.

Or you could wait for another direct bus to Dharamshala. The catch here was that we would be reaching there not before 12a.m. without any advance room bookings.

Otherwise we could have alwawys booked a room at Mandi and waited for the next morning to think about the further plans.

We chose the 6o'clock bus. If you have ever gotten into a BEST bus(referring to the local state transport for Bombay), our bus was worse than that. I could hardly position my legs in a comfortable way. Sleeping was out of question.

Fast forward some uncomfortable hours, I was jolted by a thud at my feet. Next thing I know, a man was literally down at my feet. A tinge of alcohol arose from under his breath. It became apparant that he did not fall down from his seat by the violent jerks which the driver didn't care giving the passengers.

His fellow mate (or what I assumed him to be) swooped him up from my feet before I keep my bag aside and do and placed him back to his seat.

We reached Dharamshala's ISBT some minutes shiar than 12:30a.m. In search of a hotel, we started roaming the streets. There was nobody to be found on the streets, Leave alone dogs. Well I didn't expect anybody to be out of their houses at that unearthly hour but we couldn't even see any buses plying.

We got a decent room after some hurried searching and settled down. The squemish feeling since Mandi didn't go away hence I didn't want anything to eat. But Devaraj was feeling uncomfortably hungry. He went out in search of some food at a time when most people are having their first REM sleep!

To both of our surprise, he did find a local dhaba serving roti sabzi and dal. While Deveraj was gobbling down his supper, I read on that our honorable Chief Minister, Jayalalitha had passed away! News of which came as a shocker for both of us.

Sleep came naturally to both of us and both of us greeted our families on phone with a good afternoon as it was past 12 when we woke up.

## Sidhpur

Next stop was the famed Norbulingka institute. I would say it would be the best place for someone visiting Dharamshala who wants to have a closer look at the Tibetan culture and how they live their daily lives.

You had workshops which taught you about the traditional wood carving practices, the 3-D wall paintings which you could see on monastries, the bronze buddha idols which are hand crafted to perfection in the local workshop. It was beautiful!

The whole compound resonated tibetan architechture. They had a musuem which had exhibits displaying how different sects of the buddhist community dressed like all the way from the comman man to the wifes of kings.

We thought about dropping by the souvenir shop to find something in our budget but we were so wrong! But it was well maintained. I give them that.

We came back to our room and had our dinner after some time.

## McLeodGanj

Way back in the 1930s, McLeodGanj was literally left for ruins when it was hit with an earthquake. It was brought back to the scene when the exiled Tibetan govt was given refuge in the hills of McLeodGanj.

The honorable Dalai Lama and his house of ministers all reside in an around that area. I found that the tibetan souvenirs, if to be bought were much cheaper in comparison to kasol/shimla/manali. Well this was to be expected as a large population of exiled tibetan refugees stay here. So if you want to shop. This is the place to do so!

We hopped around some shops and had our refreshments. And left for triund.

## Triund

As planned, our trek to Triund started when we reached McLeodGanj. Heck we had to give up on Kheerganga for this one.

We started at around 12:30p.m and expected the 7 km uphill trek to be completed within 3-4 hours. At least that's wha t we thought about.

The path to the top of the hill is not full of short passes Mind you we had our rucksacks and in my case it was no less than 10 kilos(thanks a lot to the carefree shopping we did in Manali and elsewhere!). And the path was not what you find in your regular roads.

Loose placed rocks, rubble, dry grass mixed with the dump of local herders cattle. You name it!

The initial wider and plane track gave way to a much narrow and harder path. We had our moments where we had an extremely beautiful view of McLeodGanj in front of us and there were times when Deveraj would almost collapse of fatigue(yeah, he has a heart condition which he didn't tell me before). But never the less.

There were 3-4 shops placed at the edge of the path where you could buy chocolates, water bottles and maggi. They sold things at 2x the MRP but I think this is justified.

The only means of taking goods up the hill are donkeys and I will say that it's not an easy task at all. Each donkey costs 800 INR a day from the campsite. The shops have a dustbin where they store all the garbage to be given back to the same donkeys when they come back on a U-turn. The charges for the garbage bag is cheap. 9/- INR per bag. Enough with the tariffs.

So we reached the famous magic view cafe. Well it's not exactly the typical CCD or barista that we frequent. But apparantly, it's the oldest `chai` point on the way to triund's top.

After some refreshments and countless pit stops, we did reach the top. I mean finally!

We reached just before the sunset and the view! It was ethereal. The sun rays falling down on the dhauladhar mountain range. The dogs running around and playing with each other occasionally coming to the lap of the tea stall owner, wagging his tail for some buscuits.

Pain, fatigue and thirst were long lost friends when we sat down and drank the last few gulps of water left in our bottles. I felt saintly!

> Deveraj was as usual puffing on to one of his Marlboro's while I checked my cell phone for any coverage. Zero signal! But what else do you expect at 2875 meters above sea level!

We got ours tents fixed and settled down our bags in them and got out to join the others in the bonfire. We had a very diverse group of people in our vicinity. Some came from Mumbai, a group of students from Delhi University and some from Banaras.

As we gulped down our modest plate of `Dal Chawal` (which costs a bomb!) we talked about our experiences and past. Our travel shenanigans. Discussed our plans in life like we were childhood friends reunited after a long time!

Time for sleep came a lot early for me as I was feeling really cold and fatigued. I slept with 3 layers of clothes, a muffler, a bunny cap and a sleeping bag on top of it! And still I was shaking vigorously.

So here we were watching "Harry Potter and the deathly hallows" on Deveraj's phone, sharing his earpieces. And before I knew it I was fast asleep.

I don't know what the time was, but I woke up to some heavy breathing nearby. I thought it was Devaraj vaping but he was fast asleep.

Turned out the dog decided to sleep right next to me. I could literally feel his hot and heavy breath, continuously near me. I told Deveraj that a black came to visit us in the morning! And he was gullible enough to even say OMG for a second.

I woke up at around 6o'clock. You will actually have to be there to just feel what it felt like. We had one side the Dhauladhar mountain range in front us which looked like molton lava dripping from top and on the other side we saw the city of McLeodGanj through the misty clouds.

We had our cup of maggi and left as soon as possible.

I boarded a bus to Chandigarh from Dharamshala and Deveraj got on a bus to Delhi.

Best trip till now for me!
