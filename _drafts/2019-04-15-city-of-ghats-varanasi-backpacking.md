The morning came in like a haze, the flight journey ended as soon as it started. The road from the airport to the
[Bangali Tola](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/varanasi/activities/varanasi-bengali-tola-walking-tour/a/pa-act/v-7330P11/356519)
took me close to an hour and a half from the Airport to reach in a shared cab. The road from the airport to Bengali Tola
where my hostel was situated was quite a long one. As I reached closer and closer to my destination, the roads kept getting 
narrower and I could see swathes of people hurrying towards the city.

One could see enroachments on either side of the road, trying to make up for the lost space which they lost for the road
expansion. Another thing which I noticed was that there were quite a few beat cops being posted at various locations. 

As the sun shined with all it's might. The city, which was named Benaras by the Britishers had woken up from it's deep
slumber, to cater to the never ending inflow of visitors from all across India and the world. 

Sleep was something which I had been craving ever since I was jolted awake when my vessel landed in Kashi and I the cool
breeze from the air conditioner made me fall asleep in no time. 

By the time when I woke up, it was already lunch time. And I quickly grabbed my small backpack with my wallet and my phone
to get some food. I didn't wanna eat at the hostel as I wanted to explore the streets of Bangali Tola, which as the name 
suggests had quite a lot of folks from Kolkata. Given there is a not a lot of distance between Kolkata and Varanasi.  

The Ganges provides water to more than 500 million people out there in India as it flows across 11 states, far more than
any other river out there in the world. It being one of the most sacred rivers to Hindus.
