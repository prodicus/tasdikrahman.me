Trying to follow up with the manager of [Khawa karko](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d7925789-Reviews-Khawa_Karpo-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html) as Sushant and Rajat also finished their sharing of dinner which we were grabbing to call it a day. We all rushed as I grabbed my takeaway, to get a [rick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickshaw) to catch my bus which was due to leave in about 15mins or so.

Didn't try bargaining too much and just went ahead with the exorbitant charge for the meagre ~1km which was to be traversed.

Reaching the bus stop, Deepak was waiting already for me to board the bus whose tickets we had booked 2-3days ago.

Fast forward a few more tense moments, till we manage to switch seats with someone to have both of us sitting together, we settled into our seats for good and off we went, the bus zooming through the traffic as we edged closer to leaving the city behind. Zoning out looking out of the window, looking at the city dwellers leaving office and going back in their shiny cars and two wheelers made me realise that most of us are part of the same race, each day when we try getting back to out lives after work.

And this was my moment I guess.

And what better timing could it have been. I was visiting during the legendary [Nehru Trophy Boat Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehru_Trophy_Boat_Race), the cherry on top being that [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar) was gonna visit too being one of the chief guests.

Morning shined bright on our faces waking us up to the serene view in front of us, the drenched roads with the fresh bits of rainfall, the trees growing on the side of the road, making way for us as we swisshed passed them.

All of this, while checking google maps constantly to look for when do we need to get off to get
