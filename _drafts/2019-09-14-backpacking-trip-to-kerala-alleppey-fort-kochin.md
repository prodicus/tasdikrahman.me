> I did this trip last year, in August 2019. Finishing this was long overdue.

Trying to follow up with the manager of [Khawa karko](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d7925789-Reviews-Khawa_Karpo-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html) as Sushant and Rajat also finished their sharing of dinner which we were grabbing to call it a day. We all rushed as I grabbed my takeaway, to get a [rick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickshaw) to catch my bus which was due to leave in about 15mins or so.

Didn't try bargaining too much and just went ahead with the exorbitant charge for the meagre ~1km which was to be traversed.

Reaching the bus stop, Deepak was waiting already for me to board the bus whose tickets we had booked 2-3days ago.

Fast forward a few more tense moments, till we manage to switch seats with someone to have both of us sitting together, we settled into our seats for good and off we went, the bus zooming through the traffic as we edged closer to leaving the city behind. Zoning out looking out of the window, looking at the city dwellers leaving office and going back in their shiny cars and two wheelers made me realise that most of us are part of the same race, each day when we try getting back to out lives after work. Only difference today being, that I was escaping away back from the humdrum of the city to something new. That new being. God's own Country - Kerala

As I devoured my takeaway from Khawa korpo, I felt giddy happy as I have always wanted to visit Kerala, which is something which I wanted to do while I was doing my [solo trip](https://tasdikrahman.me/2019/03/22/solo-backpacking-trip-to-hampi-gokarna-goa-budget/) in the south-western edge some years back. And this was my moment I guess.

## Alleppey

And what better timing could it have been. I was visiting during the legendary [Nehru Trophy Boat Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehru_Trophy_Boat_Race), the cherry on top being that [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar) was gonna visit too being one of the chief guests.

Morning shined bright on our faces waking us up to the serene view in front of us, the drenched roads with the fresh bits of rainfall, the trees growing on the side of the road, making way for us as we swisshed passed them.

All of this, while checking google maps constantly to look for when do we need to get off the bus to be nearest to the hostel where we were gonna crash in Alleppey.

Similar to the gokarna trip, I managed to get bunk beds for me and Deepak in Zostel Alleppey, and off we went walking with out rucksacks towards the hostel, looking at google maps every now and then to check if we were not headed in the wrong direction.

Luckily, we got a rick to deliver us straight in front of the hostel. It was still super early for us to checkin to our rooms, but our host was kind enough to let us keep our rucksacks aside and let us use the washrooms.

I love how zostels have always ended up placing their hostels at some really gorgeous places. This being no different, it was right next to the Alleppey beach!

Another early bird was [Sameeksha](https://khatiwarasamiksha.wordpress.com/), who had arrived maybe a day or two earlier than us to the zostel and we ended up striking a conversation with her and our host about the things which we had planned on doing.

As [Anirudh](https://twitter.com/anirudh2403) had bailed out the last minute of the whole thing, we had an extra ticket spare with us for the Nehru tropy, which Sameeksha was ready to grab as we were laying down our plan for the day, to her.

After dilly dallying for a bit on whether to have breakfast right now or later, we went ahead with skipping it till we reached the venue as we heard from our host that the whole thing gets very crowded and the seats are assigned on a first come first serve basis, which made us not risk getting a distant seat in the stands. 

As we arrived closer to the venue, famished with walking almost more than a km or two, guessing the main entrance of the race, which we had highly underestimated when we got down of our rick. We caved in with our hunger pang and decided to try out a small restaurant which was right next to the road which we had to follow to get to the entrance of the event. 

To just describe this road, the road had an adjacent canal running next to it, which had a lot of boats, ranging from the size of a small canoe to that a decently sized ferry which would be able to carry at least 20-30 people. Their operators trying to woo us with their tarrifs, for them to chaperone one around the canals as well as the backwaters, bundling meals along with the whole deal.

Coming back to what we ate, I ordered some appam for myself, of which I repeated another serving of the same, along with some chicken dosa.

Filling out our tummies, gave us the energy to trod faster towards the venue and take our seats.

The atmosphere was electric to say the least, everyone cheering their own team, clear evidence of a few rivalries between a few teams, the sound of the vuvuzela echoing the stands, the vendors shuttling around, trying to keep up with the demands of the buyers, rain droplets hitting your countenance as you cheer for the rowers from each team as they row with the mission of winning. All of this happening in the middle of the majestic backwaters.

It also accompanied a lovely cultural show being put up by folks as we started the race, which they were performing on the top of huge boats.
