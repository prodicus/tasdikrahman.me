> This is a long pending blog post from my trip to Varanasi, which I made in April, 2019.

The commute from the nearest airport to the city is about an hours drive max, if there's no traffic while you enter the city, luckily for me, there wasn't any that day. 

The cab driver had to drop me off a few hundred meters away from where I had booked my stay at a local hostel, which was a 3 min walk from [Dashashwamedh Ghat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashashwamedh_Ghat) which is one of the main ghats in Varanasi, on the Ganga River.
