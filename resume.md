<p class="message">
    This page contains a copy of my resume and is in PDF format (LaTeX doesn't output to Word format so yeah, that's much about it.)

    <br><br>The fastest way to reach me would be through <a href="mailto:tasdik95@gmail.com" > email</a>. 

    <br><br><i>The blue highlights in the resume would be links to the references.</i>
