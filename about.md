title: About Me
---

This site is a partial collection of projects I've worked on, stories I've written down, software I've published.

I love working on tools, infrastructure and helping scale systems from ground up. Started out as a [pythonista](https://python.org/) but I mostly dabble around in [golang](https://golang.org) and [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) these days.

When not writing code, I can be found playing football (soccer if you may), watching EPL (Go Chelsea!), [backpacking](https://tasdikrahman.me/blog/tag/travel/) across the Indian subcontinent and outside of it once in a while, tending to my home garden, watching the local theatre companies perform or trying to improve my skills at [Argentine tango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_tango) over at a milonga. You might find me with a [book/kindle](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19151223-tasdik-rahman) if we stumble upon each other.

A list of talks given by me, can be found [here](https://tasdikrahman.me/speaking/).

I am always a [tweet](https://twitter.com/tasdikrahman) away if you have something interesting in mind.

If you are an `IRC` person, I will be there with the handle `tasdikrahman` hanging around OFTC as well as on freenode.

_I write about a lot of things on this blog, but it doesn't and has never represented the opinion of any of my employers. This is a personal blog I write in my off-hours_
