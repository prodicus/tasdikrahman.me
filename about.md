This site is a partial collection of projects I've worked on, stories I've written down, software I've published.

I love working on tools, infrastructure and helping scale applications from ground up. Started out as a [pythonista](https://python.org/) but I mostly program in [golang](https://golang.org) and [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) now.

When not writing code, I can be found playing football (soccer if you may), watching EPL (Go Chelsea!), backpacking across the Indian subcontinent and outside of it once in a while, tending to my home garden, watching the local theatre companies perform or watch the local comics at [the comedy club](https://www.comedywagon.com/).

You can find the list of talks given by me [here](https://tasdikrahman.me/speaking/)

I am always a [tweet](https://twitter.com/tasdikrahman) away if you have something interesting in mind.

If you are an `IRC` person, I will be there with the handle `tasdikrahman` hanging around OFTC as well as on freenode.

_I write about a lot of things on this blog, but it doesn't and has never represented the opinion of any of my employers. This is a personal blog I write in my off-hours_
