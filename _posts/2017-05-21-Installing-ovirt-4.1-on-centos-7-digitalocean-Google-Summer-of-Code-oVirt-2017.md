Was trying to install oVirt engine on a VM deployed on DigitalOcean. My learnings from it are documented here.

## Installing oVirt Engine

I would concentrate on the part of just installing oVirt-engine as I had a fair share of problems while doing so.

The VM I am installing it on is a 4GB centOS 7 box with 80GB of SSD to spare for. Also, make sure you read through the whole requirements [mentioned on the official docs](http://www.ovirt.org/documentation/quickstart/quickstart-guide/#ovirt-engine) while going forward with this.

A quick run through of what oVirt is. If you have used vSphere by VMWare, this product offered by Redhat is a competitor to it.

The oVirt platform consists of at least one oVirt Engine and one or more Nodes.

- oVirt Engine provides a graphical user interface to manage the physical and logical resources of the oVirt infrastructure.
- oVirt Engine runs virtual machines.

oVirt Engine is the control center of the oVirt environment. It allows you to define hosts, configure data centers, add storage, define networks, create virtual machines, manage user permissions and use templates from one central location.

## Installation

```

The most important thing to note above in the `engine-setup` command is the FQDN for the VM. You need this for accessing the Engine administration portal.

Take a look at this specific part

```bash
...
[ INFO  ] Restarting httpd
          Please use the user 'admin@internal' and password specified in order to login
          Web access is enabled at:
              http://ovirt.gsoc.org:80/ovirt-engine
              https://ovirt.gsoc.org:443/ovirt-engine
...
```

For resolving the admin portal, we need to add an entry inside `/etc/hosts` inside the VM first.

```bash
[root@centos-4gb-blr1-ovirt-engine ~]# cat /etc/hosts
# Your system has configured 'manage_etc_hosts' as True.
# As a result, if you wish for changes to this file to persist
# then you will need to either
# a.) make changes to the master file in /etc/cloud/templates/hosts.redhat.tmpl
# b.) change or remove the value of 'manage_etc_hosts' in
#     /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg or cloud-config from user-data
# The following lines are desirable for IPv4 capable hosts
127.0.0.1 centos-4gb-blr1-ovirt-engine centos-4gb-blr1-ovirt-engine
127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost
127.0.0.1 localhost4.localdomain4 localhost4

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1 centos-4gb-blr1-ovirt-engine centos-4gb-blr1-ovirt-engine
::1 localhost.localdomain localhost
::1 localhost6.localdomain6 localhost6

xxx.xx.xx.xxx ovirt.gsoc.org
[root@centos-4gb-blr1-ovirt-engine ~]#
```

Where xxx.xx.xx.xxx would be the public IP of my VM.

So if you now do a `ping` to `ovirt.gsoc.org`, out local DNS would be successfully able to resolve the FQDN

```bash
[root@centos-4gb-blr1-ovirt-engine ~]# ping ovirt.gsoc.org
PING ovirt.gsoc.org (xxx.xx.xx.xxx) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from ovirt.gsoc.org (xxx.xx.xx.xxx): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.034 ms
64 bytes from ovirt.gsoc.org (xxx.xx.xx.xxx): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.041 ms
64 bytes from ovirt.gsoc.org (xxx.xx.xx.xxx): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.033 ms
^C
--- ovirt.gsoc.org ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 1999ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.033/0.036/0.041/0.003 ms
[root@centos-4gb-blr1-ovirt-engine ~]#
```

Now on the local dev box, I did the same thing with my `/etc/hosts`

```bash
$ cat /etc/hosts
...
# DO server
xxx.xx.xx.xxx ovirt.gsoc.org
...
```

Now it's resolvable from my local dev box too

```bash
$ ping ovirt.gsoc.org
PING ovirt.gsoc.org (xxx.xx.xx.xxx): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from xxx.xx.xx.xxx: icmp_seq=0 ttl=59 time=5.322 ms
^C
--- ovirt.gsoc.org ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 5.322/5.322/5.322/0.000 ms
```

## Admin portal

Now on your dev box, check the admin panel by going to the url https://ovirt.gsoc.org:443/ovirt-engine

Let's take the admin panel for a spin

Isn't she pretty?

Had been fighting with some dumb defaults for almost an hour. It's 5 am. in the morning. So I need to get some sleep. Stay tuned!

## Debugging tips

- make sure its (the remote host where you are installing `ovirt-engine`) resolvable from your machine.
- check if the engine is running (check `/var/log/engine.log` and `ovirt-engine` service)
- check firewall on the machine.
- try to connect to the web browser from the virtual machine to be sure its not network issue between you and VM `ping your.vm.com` should resolve that ip address
